Create an image. Draw a train car -- a black/dark charcoal (#2C2C2C) coal hopper car. Flat 2D side-view profile, facing right. Vintage 1920s poster style with warm tones and thick outlines. Dark warm brown wheels and undercarriage. Transparent background. No text, no borders, no frames. Bold simplified shapes. The coal hopper should have an open top and sloped sides. Even though the car body is dark, there should still be visible contrast between the car body and the undercarriage -- use slightly different dark tones and clear outlines to separate them.
