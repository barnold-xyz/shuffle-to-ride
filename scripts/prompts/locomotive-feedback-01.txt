This is my previous attempt. Two problems:

1. THE LOCOMOTIVE IS FACING THE WRONG DIRECTION. It must face RIGHT (the cowcatcher/front should be on the RIGHT side of the image, the cab/rear on the LEFT). Currently it's facing left. Mirror it.

2. THE RAINBOW IS TOO GARISH. The color treatment should be much more subtle -- think of an iridescent or prismatic metallic sheen, not bold rainbow stripes. The colors should be muted warm tones that hint at the other train car colors in the set (warm red, rust orange, gold, forest green, steel blue, dusty purple) rather than bright saturated rainbow colors. It should look like light playing across burnished metal, not a pride flag painted on a train.

Keep everything else: the locomotive shape, warm brown wheels, vintage poster style, no smoke, transparent background.
