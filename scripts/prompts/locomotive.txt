Create an image. Draw a classic steam locomotive. Flat 2D side-view profile, facing right. Vintage 1920s poster style with warm tones and thick outlines. Dark warm brown wheels and undercarriage.

This is a special WILD CARD locomotive. The body should have a rainbow/multicolor treatment -- the boiler and cab should show a gradient or blend cycling through red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Think iridescent or prismatic metal, not garish rainbow stripes.

NO SMOKE coming out of the smokestack. Keep the stack clean and empty.

Transparent background. No text, no borders, no frames. Bold simplified shapes. The locomotive should have a cowcatcher at the front (right side), smokestack, boiler, and engineer's cab.
