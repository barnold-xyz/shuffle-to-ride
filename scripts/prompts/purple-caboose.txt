Create an image. Draw a train car -- a purple (#7B2D8B) caboose. Flat 2D side-view profile, facing right. Vintage 1920s poster style with warm tones and thick outlines. Dark warm brown wheels and undercarriage. Transparent background. No text, no borders, no frames. Bold simplified shapes. The caboose should have a cupola (raised lookout section) on top and a railed platform at the rear end.
