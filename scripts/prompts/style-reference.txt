This is my reference image showing the exact style I want. Generate a new train car in EXACTLY this same style: same warm vintage poster illustration feel, same thick outline quality, same warm brown wheels and undercarriage, same flat 2D side-view profile, same level of detail, same proportions. The ONLY things that should change are the car body COLOR and the car TYPE. Everything else -- line weight, shading approach, wheel design, coupler style, overall proportions -- must match this reference exactly.
