Create an image. Draw a train car -- a cream/off-white (#D4C5B0) tanker car with a cylindrical tank body. Flat 2D side-view profile, facing right. Vintage 1920s poster style with warm tones and thick outlines. Dark warm brown wheels and undercarriage. Transparent background. No text, no borders, no frames. Bold simplified shapes. The tank should be a large horizontal cylinder sitting on the flat car frame.
