Create an image. Draw a train car -- a yellow (#DAA520) passenger coach. Flat 2D side-view profile, facing right. Vintage 1920s poster style with warm tones and thick outlines. Dark warm brown wheels and undercarriage. Transparent background. No text, no borders, no frames. Bold simplified shapes. The passenger coach should have a row of windows along the side.
